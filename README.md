Formalisation of Overtaking traffic rules 
================================

This project is about formalising traffic rules from German Highway Code, or _Strassenverkehrsordnung (StVO)_ in German, especially the overtaking paragraph. The government of Germany has been very forward thinking by publishing their law in GitHub for ease of access; you can read the whole StVO [here][1] (in German).
